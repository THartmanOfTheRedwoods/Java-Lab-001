* The source code file you will edit is in the src folder and contains a Java class file named HelloXwing.java
* Modify the HelloXwing.java file to print out to the **console** the xwing() method.
* Run your program, verify an ascii-art X-Wing prints to the console, and save your changes.
* Commit your changes back to your GitHub account and follow the video on doing a Pull request to the instructor account.

1. In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?
2. What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
3. In common English, what does the word compile mean?
4. What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?

1. Statements are the elements that make up programs. The ";" (semi-colon) symbol is used to end statements. It is called the "statement terminator." Comments are used for making notes to help people better understand programs.
2. A portable program, also known as standalone, is a software product that can be easily moved between computing environments. Portable apps can be added to, run, and removed from any compatible computer without needing to be set up or require other software to be installed. 
3. Compile just means to assume that a program is complete, or ready for others to view, and make it executable.
4. An executable is the simplest form of program. It can be started at any point, without any other programs running. It may open other programs, or modify your files.
