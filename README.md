## English Vs Computer Science (Fight!)

1. A statement is part of the program that specifies one step of an algorithm while a comment contains information about the program but has no effect when the program runs. 
2. A program is portable when it has the ability to run on more than one kind of computer. 
3. In common English, compile means to produce by assembling information that was collected from other sources. 
4. An executable is another name for object code that is ready to run on a specific hardware. It is used as a noun because it is the word that represents a thing, in this case, the translated program.
