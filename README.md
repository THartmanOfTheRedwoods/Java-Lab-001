### English Vs. Computer Science (Fight!)
As described in chapter 1, computer scientist often employ common English as domain specific terms. Let's explore that idea in the following questions from Exercise 1.1
1. **In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?**
   * A statement is an instruction for a particular step in a program, while a comment contains information about a program but is not interpreted as an instruction and has no effect on the program.
1. **What does it mean to say that a program is portable?**
    * This means that a program can be run on more than one type of computer.
1. **In common English, what does the word compile mean?**
    * It means to translate from a high-level language to a low-level language.
1. **What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?**
    * An executable is code that is ready to run on specific hardware. It is used as a noun to refer to code that has already been compiled and is ready to be "executed".
