  1. In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?
  A statement is a line of code that performs a basic action, while a comment is a bit of English text that explains the code. Comments have no effect on the execution of the program, but they make it easier for other programmers to understand what you meant to do.
  2. What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
  Portable means that a program can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications.
  3. In common English, what does the word compile mean?
  The word compile means to compose out of materials from other documents.
  4. What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?
  An executable is the translated program, or the object code. This word is used as a noun because it refers to the object code, which is also a noun.
