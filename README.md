Exercise 1.1
1.In computer jargon, what’s the difference between a statement and a comment?
A statement actually executes a command that’ll appear onto the screen. A comment is only text inside the code in the back-end. It can, of course, hold anything, but it mostly used to describe the code. It doesn’t have any effect.
2.What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
	You’re able to use the program without needed any kinds of updates or newer software. It’s easier to port.
3.In common English, what does the word compile mean?
	To put together. Building a list or a collection.  
4.What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?
		It’s a noun because it is a “thing”. It is only a file that holds a program that is ready to be run on hardware.
